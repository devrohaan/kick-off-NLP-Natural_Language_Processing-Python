## Natural Language Processing: A Py Kick-off Digest! 
###### Natural Language Processing in Python.

# Python NLP Libraries
*... simplifing the text preprocessing and thus building better machine learning models*

There are many tools and libraries designed to solve NLP problems. In this write-up, I want to outline the most popular and helpful natural language processing libraries in python and JAVA, based on my experience. I have observed that all these libraries have overlapping tasks. So, sometimes it is hard to compare them directly.

> :heavy_exclamation_mark: **Disclaimer:** These are not the only NLP libraries out there! If you look for NLP on PyPi you will find more than 470 packages and libraries. It would be difficult to highlight all of them at one place.


|Library|	Features | Docs |
| :--- |:---| :---:|
|**spaCy**	|Extremely optimized NLP library that is meant to be operated together with deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Spacy is the main competitor of the NLTK |[spaCy Dosc](https://spacy.io/api/) |
|**Gensim**	| Gensim is the package for topic and vector space modeling, document similarity.| [Gensim Dosc](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/apiref.html)|
|**Pattern**|	Web (data) mining / crawling and common NLP tasks. :heavy_exclamation_mark: No support for python3.| [Pattern Docs](https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/pattern) |
|**NLTK** | The ‘mother’ of all NLP libraries. Excellent for educational purposes and the de-facto standard for many NLP tasks. NLTK is used for such tasks as tokenization, lemmatization, stemming, parsing, POS tagging, etc. This library has tools for almost all NLP tasks.| [NLTK Dosc](https://www.nltk.org/) |
|**Google Cloud NL API**|:star: NLP, AI and Everything in between.|[Google Docs](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/)|
|**TextBlob**|	Modern multi-purpose NLT toolset that is really great for fast and easy development.|[TextBlob Docs](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/)|
|**Polyglot**|	Multilingualism and transliteration capabilities.|[Polyglot Docs](https://polyglot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation.html) |
|**Vocabulary**|	Retrieve semantic information from individual words.| [Vocabulary Docs](https://pypi.org/project/Vocabulary/)|
|**PyNLPl**|	Extensive functionality regarding FoLiA XML and many other common NLP format (CQL, Giza, Moses, ARPA, Timbl, etc.).| [PyNLPl Docs](https://pynlpl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) |
|**Stanford CoreNLP**| Python	Reliable, robust and accurate NLP platform based on a client-server architecture. Written in Java, and accessible trough multiple Python wrapper libraries.|[CoreNLP Docs](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/other-languages.html)|
|**MontyLingua**|	End-to-end NLP processor working with Python and Java.| [MontyLingua Docs](http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~hugo/montylingua/#documentation)|
|**scikit-Learn**|Highly Efficient Deep Learning Models|[cikit-Learn Docs](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)|
